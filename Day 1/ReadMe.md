# Basic Implementaion of MP Neuron
The MP Neuron or McCulloch-Pitts Neuron is one of the basic elements of Artificial Neural Network. In this code, I have tried to provide with the basic functionality of it, that is, training the MP Neuron model based on the dataset provided in the sklearn or scikit-learn in python.
The code is implemented using Python as the programming language. I've imported the libraries like:
# sklearn:- 
For providing the dataset
# numpy:- 
Implementing the numpy arrays
# pandas:-
For forming DataFrame and also for the binary conversion
# matplotlib:-
For plotting the different graphs showing the training and testing sets of data
In this code I have calculated the best theta and the best accuracy value in a predefined range for the theta, that is, 1-30 including the boundaries and used this best calculated theta for the test data accuracy calculations and prediction.
