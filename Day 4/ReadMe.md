# DAY 4
In these codes I have implemented the Login XOR Gate checking method of a Perceptron.

# PERCEPTRON
A perceptron is a single neuron based system in Artificial Neural Networks. It gives output as y-cap and testifies it with the theoritical outputs of the Logic table. The formula used is:-

sigma(Wi*Xi) for all i=[0,n] here n is the no of inputs provided, and having X0=-1
if the sum >=0, then output(or y-cap)=1 else output(or y-cap)=0

In the first program two inputs are provided and the stabilization of the program is checked and in the second code three inputs have been provided and the stabilization is checked.
