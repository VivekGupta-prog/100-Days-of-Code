# 100-Days-of-Code
Practising everyday to implement what we study gives a boost to both our brain power and our motivation to excel much more tomorrow than what we excelled today. In this folder I'll show my journey from starting as a new programmer to becoming a good coder by going through coding everyday for the coming 100 days. This is my 100 Days coding Challenge that I gave to myself in the hopes of achieving what is my dream, that is, becoming a good coder and improving my problem skills.
There could be few codes with some mistakes.
# Day 1:-
Using libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn to calculate the accuracies and the best value of theta for MP Neuron in Aritificial Neural Network.
# Day 2:-
Implementation of Perceptron using Logic AND Gate for two inputs and three inputs.
# Day 3:-
Implementation of Perceptron using Logic OR Gate for two and three inputs.
# Day 4:-
Implementation of Perceptron using Logic XOR Gate for two and three inputs.
