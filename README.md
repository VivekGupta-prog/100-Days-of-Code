# 100-Days-of-Code
Practising everyday to implement what we study gives a boost to both our brain power and our motivation to excel much more tomorrow than what we excelled today. In this folder I'll show my journey from starting as a new programmer to becoming a good coder by going through coding everyday for the coming 100 days. This is my 100 Days coding Challenge that I gave to myself in the hopes of achieving what is my dream, that is, becoming a good coder and improving my problem skills.
